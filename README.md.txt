Programming language used: C
Content based strictly on the provided Data Structures and Algorithms PDF 

datastructures and Algorithms

1) Code to represent each data structure classification and type (C language)
A. Linear Data Structures
1. Array
Elements stored in contiguous memory locations.

Direct access using index.
2. Linked List
Nodes stored in non-contiguous memory.

Each node contains data and a pointer.
3. Stack (LIFO)
Insertion and deletion from the same end (top).
4. Queue (FIFO)
Insert at rear, delete from front.
B. Non-Linear Data Structures
5. Tree (Binary Tree)
Hierarchical parent-child relationship.

6. Graph (Adjacency Matrix)
Vertices connected by edges.

Can contain cycles.

2) Where data structure types are applied and reasons


| Data Structure | Application Area  | Reason                            |
| -------------- | ----------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Array          | Student records   | Fast random access                |
| Linked List    | Memory management | Dynamic size, efficient insertion |
| Stack          | Function calls    | Manages recursion (LIFO)          |
| Queue          | Operating systems | Process scheduling (FIFO)         |
| Tree           | File systems      | Hierarchical organization         |
| Graph          | Networks          | Models complex relationships      |


3) Examples of applications using data structures and algorithms
Array

Application: Spreadsheet software

Algorithm: Traversing, sorting

Reason: Efficient storage of homogeneous data

Stack

Application: Compilers

Algorithm: Function call stack

Reason: Ensures correct execution order

Queue

Application: CPU scheduling

Algorithm: Round-robin scheduling

Reason: Fair resource sharing

Tree

Application: Database indexing (B-Trees)

Algorithm: Logarithmic search

Reason: Fast data retrieval

Graph

Application: Routing systems

Algorithm: Shortest path algorithms

Reason: Efficient path computation

4) How data structures and algorithms work within systems

Data structures organize data efficiently in memory.

Algorithms define step-by-step operations performed on these structures.

Operating systems use:

Queues for managing processes

Stacks for handling function calls

Trees for file organization

Algorithm efficiency is evaluated using time complexity and space complexity,

datastructures and Algorithms

Proper selection of data structures reduces execution time, memory usage, and system overload.
